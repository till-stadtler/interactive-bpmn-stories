# Interactive BPMN Stories

## Why BPMN Stories?

While BPMN and DMN are easy-to-learn modeling notations, using them to their fullest capacity, as with everything, takes practice.

This webapp provides a framework to create interactive stories that allow teaching either specific features of the modeling languages, or more intricate patterns and use cases.

These stories consist of a messenger-style conversation, and a canvas to display BPMN, DMN and Form files, including the BPMN token simulation to make learning even more easy.

## Example Stories

You can find some example stories in the [Camunda Consulting Github](https://camunda-consulting.github.io/interactive-bpmn-tools/#/bpmn-stories).

## Features

- Create conversations between up to 4 participants + narration
- Use questions and answers to lead the story along different threads
- Display one or more BPMN, DMN and Form files alongside your story
- Conclude your story with good and bad endings

## Technical Details

The stories are configured and described via a TypeScript file. Each story contains two lists of threads: one for messages, one for files. Threads can be used to react to correct/false answers from the user.

Assets are stored in the `/public/` folder and imported from there.

## How To Fork

### Technical Prerequisites

- Git client
- Github account
- Node.js
- IDE of your choice

### Grab a Copy of the Code

1. [Fork](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/interactive-bpmn-stories/fork) the repository: <img src="readme_assets/image-2.png" alt="Fork button" width="110" />
2. Clone your forked copy: `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR_NAME>/interactive-bpmn-stories.git`.
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd interactive-bpmn-stories`
4. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., `code .` for Visual Studio Code).

### Build & Run the Application

1.  Build the application: `npm install`

        This should produce an output similar to this:

### Hack away!

### Publish Your Story

```bash
git add <File>
git commit -m “some commit message”
git push
```

### Create a Pull Request in the Official Repository

1. Create a pull request: <img src="readme_assets/image-1.png" alt="Pull request button" width="110" />
2. Wait for your story to be merged into the official repository.

### General Tips

- Decide what the Story will be about
  - A BPMN/DMN/Form concept
  - A specific use case
  - An onboarding experience
- Limit the scope (participants, threads)
- Split up the work
- Make use of live editing for frequent testing
- Ask for help if necessary!
